# Description
The program provides GUI and plugin system for working with FEM algorithms. It allows to load 3D geometry, generate its volumeric mesh and solve a problem, described in terms of FEM, by using user-developed plugins.

# Platforms
Initially built in Windows, the code and used dependencies are adapted for compiling on other platforms, but it is yet to be properly tested.

# Components
1. **Core** module, which handles GUI, plugin system, user IO (resides in *feata* and *feata-gui* subfolders of *src* folder).

2. **Shared** module, dedicated to link 3rdparty plugin development with the main program (folder **shared**).

3. Examplary plugins, which demonstrate the possibilites of the plugin system and the whole program.

# Used third-party software
1. **Qt 5.12.2**. The whole project is built in Qt Creator 4.8.2, and the core component intensively utilises Qt *core*, *gui* and *widget* components.

2. **Open Cascade Core Technology 7.3.0**. Provides with 3D visualisation and geometry management. 

3. **TetGen 1.5.1**. A library for building tetrahedronalizations of 3D volumes with poligonalized surface. Used in examplary mesher plugin. It is supplied with the project in the folder *src/3rdparty/tetgen*.

4. **Eigen 3.3.7**. A great header-only math library. Used for solving FEM systems of linear algebraic equations in examplary solver plugin.

# How to build

Only 64-bit architecture is supported.

During the development the project had the following structure:

+ [project-directory]
 * 3rdparty — all libraries are contained here
 * build — where goes the compiled program
 * src — like in this repository
 * resource — like in this repository
 * test — various test files

You may choose any other structure, as long as you fixate your changes in the corresponding project files (*.pro* and *.pri*).

## Windows

Here was used Visual C++ 15.0, which corresponds with Visual Studio 2017. 

1. Install Qt Creator, or use any other IDE which is able to build a Qt-based project (mostly Qt Visual Studio Tools are meant here).

2. Download and build Open Cascade according to [this manual](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_dev_guides__building.html), preferably of the version mentioned above, and make it visible for the main program by editing the main *src/feata/FEATA.pro* file (the place where to edit is marked by comment). As additional third-party product build TBB (Threading Building Blocks).

3. Open the mentioned *.pro* file in Qt-friendly IDE and compile it.

If you want to build examplary plugins, which are located in the *src* folder and tagged as *plug*, only this is required:

- Download Eigen and do the same thing for *.pro* file of the solver examplary project.

## Linux

GCC 7.3.0 was used here. 

The same as in Windows case, since all involved components are cross-platform.

# Plugin system

There are for now two types of plugins: mesher and solver. The first one is responsible for generating volumeric finite element mesh of 3D geometry (at the moment only simplex types of finite elements are supported). The second must be designed to take an output of the first one and required user input to solve problems. In application to structural analysis, for instance, it means assembling stiffness matrix and solving the general system.

There are examplary plugins, which can be used as basement for creating new ones. Mesher plugin allows to use tetrahedral mesh generated by TetGen. Solver plugin, supplied with a tetrahedral mesh and user-defined boundary conditions, solves linear elasicity problem. 

Basically, all the code required  to start plugin creation is in **src/shared** folder. For meshing, derive from class *MesherPlugin*, for solving — *SolverPlugin*, and implement required methods. It is recommended to use examplary plugins as a guide.
